# Flappy-Penguin
Penguin Animation Scene is an interactive and visually engaging project built entirely with HTML and CSS. It features a cute cartoon penguin standing in a scenic environment with mountains, sun, and ground. The penguinâ€™s left arm has a smooth waving animation, and clicking the penguin triggers a scaling effect, making it interactive.

The project demonstrates the use of CSS variables, gradients, transitions, and keyframe animations to create a playful, responsive, and fully animated scene without any JavaScript. It is ideal for learning how to combine HTML structure and CSS styling to build dynamic visual elements and interactive characters.
